📜 General Theme overview 📜

Welcome to the exciting third installment of our accelerator series, specifically designed for creators! This time, we're inviting participants to craft an imaginative world where legendary mythical beings encounter the tangible universe of Decentraland. 

Mythology, rich and varied, draws from a multitude of cultural origins. Feel free to explore either universally recognized myths or delve into more obscure & local lore. We eagerly anticipate a diverse array of submissions, mirroring the vibrant and eclectic community of Decentraland!

💡 What is the Creativity & Growth Grant? 💡

The Sandstorm Creativity & Growth grant project is a monthly program designed to foster creativity and innovation within the community around exciting themes.
Creators have the opportunity to submit their project ideas of a total allocated budget, and if selected, receive up to $2000 in funding to bring their visions to life.

This initiative aims to enrich the Decentraland experience by introducing diverse and thematic content, encouraging collaboration, and supporting the talents of our community. Whether you are an artist, developer, or storyteller, we invite you to participate and contribute to the evolving world of Decentraland!

🔮 How are ideas selected? 🔮

After the launch of each project round, the Sandstorm team will thoroughly review:
- The proposed project idea
- The proposed project Budget
- The Builder / Builder Team / Studio portfolio & capacity to execute
- The distribution of projects to cover a wide range of ideas & applications

The goal is that each rounds funding goes to complementary projects & ideas others will be able to implement & use in the future.

Please provide a deep explanation of the idea you submitted with a detailed execution plan & timeline. The description should cover:
1. What you are planing to create (assets, wearables, Scenes, Game, Code, etc.)
2. How it ties to the theme
3. Creative thoughts / ideation & how it benefits Decentraland

⏳ All ideas are expected to be completed within 4-6 weeks.

🔨 What am I supposed to build? 🔨

There are no limits to your imagination!

While we are putting emphasis on creating projects that go through the SDK7, the project rounds can cover:
✔️Production of asset packs
✔️Production of wearables
✔️Production of unique Scenes
✔️Production of small game ideas
✔️Research & development of custom mechanics around project round themes
✔️A combination of the above!

⚙️ Technical Section ⚙️

To ensure a seamless integration and experience within Decentraland, all submitted creations must be compatible with the Decentraland platform. Creators should adhere to the technical guidelines and specifications provided by Decentraland, ensuring that the projects are optimized, functional, and immersive within the virtual environment. For detailed technical requirements and guidelines, please refer to the Decentraland documentation.

Within the scope of the project round, the Sandstorm Team will be directly in touch with you to support the process & answer any open questions.

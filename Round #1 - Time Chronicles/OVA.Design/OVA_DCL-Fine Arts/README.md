# Decentraland Build - Fine Arts Gallery by OVA.Design

### Project Concept

**"Art is a mirror, a reflection of history, and an interpretation of the world." - E. A. Bucchianeri**

**This project aims to curate a collection of the world's most renowned artworks and paintings from throughout history, reimagining them in a new 3D digital format.**

A series of iconic artworks from history were selected  and showcased in a virtual gallery scene. Each artwork have its dedicated display area, consisting of two main components:

**1. 2D Image Display:** An iconic painting presented in high resolution as a 2D image hosted on an external server, complete with appropriate framing.

**2. 3D Interpretation:**  Various 2D to 3D conversion techniques were employed in creating the 3D version of the same painting. These techniques include:

- Extracting unique colors and shapes onto individual layers and stacking them in 3D space to create a parallax effect using image processing tools like Photoshop.
- Generating 3D meshes with depth maps, utilizing AI tools such as Stable Diffusion.
- Sculpting in 3D while referencing the 2D image, using 3D modeling tools like Blender or Maya.
- A combination of the above techniques.
